AK500 Digital RS is a Linux replacement for the DEEPCOOL software, which controls the display on a CPU cooler to show CPU temperature and usage. DEEPCOOL does not offer a Linux version of their software. Additionally, their current software utilizes more resources than necessary, as it is an Electron app primarily used for displaying a tray menu. AK500 Digital RS is written in Rust and functions as a lightweight background program.
