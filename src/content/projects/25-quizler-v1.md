This is my original implementation of my Quizler real-time quiz application, for quickly and easily making quizzes with an extremely small deployment size of 1.82mb making it extra portable. This is intended to be used as a quick simple LAN quiz game tool, however it can be deployed and run within a container on the cloud.
