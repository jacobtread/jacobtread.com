The **LibreHardwareMonitorService** (LHM) project allows you to access hardware information, such as CPU and GPU temperatures, on Windows from user-land code using Rust. Typically, user-land programs cannot directly access hardware information due to operating system restrictions, which require administrator privileges for such actions.
