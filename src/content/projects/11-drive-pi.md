Drive-PI is an application I wrote for a school assessment. Drive-PI acts as a network file share running on a Raspberry PI. Drive-PI will share the connected drives over its wireless hotspot along with providing a management web interface to unmount, mount and remount drives. The backend is written in rust and its frontend is written in Typescript using ReactJS.
