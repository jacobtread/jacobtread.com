**Pocket Ark** is a custom server emulator that I am writing for the **Mass Effect Andromeda** game. This server is currently under development but aims to be the **Pocket Relay** of Mass Effect 3's sequel game **Mass Effect Andromeda**. I hope to be able to provide the level of quality seen in the **Pocket Relay** server in this one as well.
