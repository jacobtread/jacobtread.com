This is software I'm working on for monitoring and controlling my "Dynamix UPSD2000 Defender" UPS. The software allows me
to control my and monitor my UPS, I have reverse engineered the USB protocol it uses and can monitor the device state and
perform actions such as self-tests. Currently the software is quite basic however, it is quite performant and coming along
nicely. This is under active development still.
