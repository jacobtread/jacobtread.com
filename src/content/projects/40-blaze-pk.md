BlazePK is an implementation of the Blaze packet system used by EA games such as Mass Effect 3 and Battlefield. This implementation is written in Rust and uses macros for wrapping structures and allowing packets to be encoded and decoded from them. This library features both async and sync reading and writing of packets. This library was deprecated in favor of my new Tdf library
