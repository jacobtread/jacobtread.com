This tool allows you to create interactive items that can be thrown at your VTube Studio model, play sounds, trigger VTube Studio hotkeys, create custom commands, and much more with custom scripting.

Inspired by KBonk, this project aims to provide a more tailored and enhanced experience, better suited to my specific needs, preferences, and implementing features that I make use of.
