**Tdf** is a library that I have written to serialize and deserialize the format used by the BlazeSDK for encoding RPC packets. This library is used by my **Pocket Relay** and **Pocket Ark** projects. The library comes with a robust set of derive macros that allow quickly and easily making enums and structures into serializable and deserializable structures.
