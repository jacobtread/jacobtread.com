Tilepad is an extensible macropad, inspired by Streamdeck, designed to run on everyday mobile devices like Android tablets and phones. It boasts a powerful system for creating and executing custom plugins, offering a high level of flexibility for developers. The protocol is WebSocket-based, allowing plugins to be written in any language that supports WebSockets. Customization is facilitated through 'Inspectors'â€”embedded HTML views that enable personalized UI for configuring plugins.
