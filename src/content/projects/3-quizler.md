Quizler is a super small, easy-to-use, and deployable app for creating quizzes that can be played across multiple devices in real time. The app is intended to be small, portable, and easy to use. This is my replacement for my original real-time quiz application (Quizler-v1). It comes with lots of new features and performance improvements.
