Custom dedicated Mass Effect 3 game server software which emulates the functionality of the official EA servers with the added benefit of allowing "Home Hosting" / LAN play. Because the server is hosted by outside of EA servers you can alter your player data. This server also includes a MITM (Man-in-the-middle) mode which creates a tunnel for connecting to the official servers which decoding all the packets in-between.
